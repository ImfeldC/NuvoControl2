
This folder contains the images generated from the class diagrams.
They are used as part of the documentation and will be used by by the Sandcastle tool 
at the time of generate the documentation.

The diagrams are made with several tools ....


------------------------------------------------------

(A) Drawbridge

This tool allows to generate picture files (*.jpg) from the class diagrams (*.cs).

--> Installation
It can be downloaded from http://www.castleapps.com/
The installation is simple, just use the default values.

--> Create Image(s)
To export one or more diagrams do the following steps:
* Open any one of your class diagrams. Right click on the diagram and select “Export Diagram as Image…” 
* You can export all the class diagrams at this time. 
  Use the existing folder 'ClassDiagrams' to store the files
* Set the image format to JPEG Interchange (*.jpg).
* Click export.
* Add new files to Subversion, to ensure they are part of the source code repository
* Now you can use the Drawbridge Sandcastle component to fully integrate the class 
  diagram images with the help file. 
(A more detailed help is provided with the Drawbridge tool.

These steps are not possible (yet) to execute as part of the build. Because of that you
need to execute these steps each time you change the class diagram(s).

--> Include in comment
To include the images in the comment, use the <a href> property, because the <img> property may not
fit into the output html style. I had som problems to add the picture directly embedded in the html
file, because the summary text is placed in a table.
As example:
    /// The following class diagram shows the protocol stack.
    /// <a href="../ClassDiagrams/ProtocolDriverOverview.jpg">ProtocolDriverOverview</a>
    /// <img src="./ClassDiagrams/ProtocolDriverOverview.jpg"/>

--> Include images in the build
The files (may) require to be added to the Sandcastle Help File Builder project (NuvoControl.shfbproj).
Ensure that the new created class diagram is part of the project.
